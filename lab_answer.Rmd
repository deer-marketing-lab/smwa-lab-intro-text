## Exercise 1: Text Analytics with Fake Reviews

This exercise works with data on hotel reviews. 
The reviews are a collection of truthful and deceptive (i.e. fake) reviews of 20 hotels in the Chicago area, known in the computational linguistics community as the Deceptive Opinion Spam dataset.^[
The data originally was published in the paper "Finding Deceptive Opinion Spam by Any Stretch of the Imagination" by M. Ott, Y. Choi, C. Cardie, and J.T. Hancock in 2011 in the Proceedings of the 49th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies
]
Deceptive reviews are reviews that have been written by someone who has not stayed at the hotel they are reviewing.
The data contains 1600 reviews:

* 400 truthful, positive reviews from TripAdvisor
* 400 deceptive positive reviews from Mechanical Turk
* 400 truthful, negative reviews from Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Priceline, TripAdvisor, and Yelp
* 400 deceptive negative reviews from Mechanical Turk

The data is saved as part of this repository, stored in `data/reviews.csv`:

You might need to use the following `R` libraries throughout this exercise:^[
    If you haven't installed one or more of these packages, do so by entering `install.packages("PKG_NAME")` into the R console and pressing ENTER.
]

```{r, eval = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(tidyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidytext)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)
library(textstem)
library(reshape2)
library(wordcloud)
```

1. Assuming online reviews are all truthful, explain whether they should benefit or harm consumers and the hotels themselves.

Write your answer here

2. If fake reviews are mixed in with truthful reviews on a website (for example, TripAdvisor) identify two reasons why their presence may harm consumers, hotels and the review website. 
Explain the mechanisms through which the harm is done.

Write your answer here

3. Load the data located in `data/reviews.csv` into a data frame called `hotel_reviews`.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


4. In what follows we will need each hotel review (i.e. each row of the data) to have a unique identifier. 
  Create a new column called `ID` in the dataset that has a unique identifier for each review.

HINT: the function `row_to_column()` function will help you do this.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


5. Convert the dataset to conform with tidy data principles:
  * Each variable is a column
  * Each observation is a row
  * Every cell is a single value

Name the resulting dataset `tidy_reviews`.
  
```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


6. Create a dataset called `review_length` that has two columns, a column that identifies the review and a column that counts the number of words in the review.
Merge the the `review_length` data into the `hotels_df` dataset.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


7. Are deceptive reviews longer than truthful reviews?
   If you presented this result to a marketing manager that has little analytics training what do you expect they would say about the possibility of detecting deceptive reviews?
   Would you agree or disagree? 

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

   
8. What are stop words? 
Explain why you would want to remove them from the review text.

Write your answer here
   
9. Remove stop words from each review using a default stop word list. Name the dataset with no stop words `tidy_reviews_no_stop`.
   What are the 20 most common words in the dataset?

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


10. Create a custom stop word list that contains words you might want to remove in addition to the default stop word list. 
Remove these words from `tidy_reviews_no_stop`.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


11. Also remove any numbers from `tidy_reviews_no_stop`.

The following code can be used to get started:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# First, find all numbers:
nums <- YOUR_CODE %>%
  # find all numbers in the data
  filter(str_detect(word, "^[0-9]")) %>%
  YOUR_CODE

# now remove those:
tidy_reviews_no_stop <- YOUR_CODE
```


```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


The next step we want to perform is to lemmatize each word.
The goal of lemmatizing is to reduce inflectional forms and some common derivationally related forms of a word to a base word.
For example: 

* am, are, is $\Rightarrow$ be
* car, cars, car's, cars' $\Rightarrow$ car

To lemmatize each word in the reviews we will use the `lemmatize_words()` from the `textstem package`:^[
    An alternative would be to "stem" each word, which essentially chops off the ends of words in the hope of achieving this goal correctly most of the time, and often includes the removal of derivational affixes.
]

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


12. Create a plot that graphs the frequency a word is used in deceptive reviews on the x-axis against the frequency the same word is used on the y-axis.
To help you in coding up this plot, your final result should look like the following:^[
Depending on your custom stopword list in (10) you might see slight differences between your figure and this one.
]

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align="center", out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/reviews_plot-01.png')
```

  Perform the following steps:
  
  (a) Create a dataset called `wrd_frequency` that has three columns: a column `word` that contains all the unique words, a column `deceptive` that has the percentage of deceptive reviews that each word is included in and a column `truthful` that has the percentage of truthful reviews that each word is included in.
  (b) Create the plot described above. 
      Include a 45 degree line for reference.

To assist you in creating the plot, use the following starter code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# part (a)
wrd_frequency <- tidy_reviews_lemma %>%
  count(YOUR_CODE) %>%
  group_by(YOUR_CODE) %>%
  mutate(YOUR_CODE) %>% 
  spread(YOUR_CODE)

# part (b)
wrd_frequency %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = YOUR_CODE, 
             y = YOUR_CODE, 
             label = YOUR_CODE 
           )) +
  geom_YOURCODE(alpha = 0.15, 
                size = 2.5
              ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = YOUR_CODE), 
            check_overlap = TRUE, 
            vjust = 1.5
            ) +
  geom_abline(YOUR_CODE,
              lty = 2, 
              color = "grey40"
              ) +
  YOUR_CODE
```


```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


An alternative way to visualize the differences and commonalities in word use between truthful and deceptive reviews is to construct word clouds.
To assist you in creating the plots, use the following starter code for each of the next two questions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tidy_reviews_lemma %>%
  count(YOUR_CODE, 
        YOUR_CODE, 
        sort = TRUE
        ) %>%
  acast(YOUR_CODE ~ YOUR_CODE, 
        value.var = "n", 
        fill = 0
        ) %>%
  YOUR_CODE
```

      
13. Create a word cloud that visualizes the differences in word use between deceptive and truthful reviews. 
Use a maximum of 75 words in the word cloud.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


14. Create a word cloud that visualizes the commonalities in word use between deceptive and truthful reviews. 
Use a maximum of 75 words in the word cloud.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```


15. Provide a brief summary of what you learn from the three plots. (Max. 10 sentences)

Write your answer here

16. (Harder!) Suppose you were working in an analytics team that wanted to build a predictive model to detect fake reviews on a platform such as TripAdvisor.

(a) Can you sketch out a method/model to predict whether a review is fake? Your method should be scaleable so that it can handle thousands of new reviews per day.
You can use any combination of words, figures, simple equations or pseudocode to explain your thoughts.

Write your answer here

(b) How could you assess how successful the model is at detecting fake reviews?

Write your answer here

(c) Suppose the model was adopted by the platform.
If you detected a newly posted review was fake, would you want to remove it from the platform? 
Or would you leave the review online with a notification that this review might be fake? 
Explain.
